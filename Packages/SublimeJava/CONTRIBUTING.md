# Before opening up a new issue
----------------------------------

* Use the search functionality to see if there's already an issue number
  dealing with the problem. If there is, please comment in the existing
  issue.
* Make sure that the issue hasn't already been fixed in the master branch.
  I don't create a new release of the plugin for every single commit so
  it is possible that the issue has already been fixed.
* Provide a small stand alone test case where the issue is reproducible.
* Make sure that the issue is with SublimeJava specifically and not
  something that's broken in Sublime Text 2.

Please do remember that I am not your personal tech support and issues related
to configuring the plugin as appropriate for your system and target platform
have a high chance as being closed immediately. I am just a single person and
the time I allocate to this project is limited. You'll have a better
chance asking on the [Sublime Text 2 forums](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/),
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) or possibly
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/) to reach a much larger audience.
